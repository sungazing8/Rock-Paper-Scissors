This is an Odin Project, assignment created to help learn the basics of javascript. I will attempt to create a 
program that emulates playing the game rock, paper, scissors.

Rock paper scissors (also known by several other names and word orders) is an intransitive hand game, 
usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an 
outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with 
the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of a "rock paper scissors"-style 
game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized 
form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.[citation needed]

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides 
to play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or 
sometimes "blunts scissors"[1]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of 
paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the 
game is tied, but is usually replayed until there is a winner.

Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping,
drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike 
truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with some degree of skill by 
recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.
